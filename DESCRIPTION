Description: Real probability distributions can be represented as the square of
    an orthogonal sum in the Hermite basis. This representation is formally
    similar to the representation of quantum mechanical states as wave
    functions, whose squared modulus is a probability density. This is
    described in more detail in "Wave function representation of probability
    distributions," by Madeleine B. Thompson <arXiv:1712.07764>. This package
    provides a reference implementation of the technique.
